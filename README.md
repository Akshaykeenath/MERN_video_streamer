Material Dashboard 2 React is our newest free MUI Admin Template based on React. If youâ€™re a developer looking to create an admin dashboard that is developer-friendly, rich with features, and highly customisable, here is your match. Our innovative MUI & React dashboard comes with a beautiful design inspired by Google's Material Design and it will help you create stunning websites & web apps to delight your clients.

**Fully Coded Elements**
Material Dashboard 2 React is built with over 70 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, nav tabs, cards, or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, which you can easily modify using MUI styled() API and sx prop. You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code because all elements are implemented.

This free MUI & React Dashboard is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless,
switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.
